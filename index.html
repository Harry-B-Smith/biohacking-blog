            <h2>The Ultimate Guide To Cold Thermogenesis</h2>
            <h4>"Cool" Health Benefits Of Cold Exposure.</h4>

            <p>Cold thermogenesis is the practice of intentionally exposing parts of the body to specific levels of cold stress.
                Solid research has shown that cold thermogenesis brings a host of health benefits, from increasing metabolism to helping to control blood glucose levels, reducing inflammation, improving sleep and recovery, and potentially fighting certain types of cancer, as well as promoting overall longevity.
                From an ancestral or evolutionary standpoint, this makes sense. Your ancestors did not evolve in conditions with temperatures consistently in the 60s and 70s. Constant temperature control is a modern, technological contrivance. Whether it was an asteroid that blocked out the sun and wiped out the dinosaurs, to reports of a flood that left the planet underwater, your ancestors at some point experienced a dark, cold world, some form of an ice age, and a very likely necessity to evolve and even thrive in cold temperatures. Some researchers have even correlated the increase and control of indoor heating to the rise in obesity (and yes, you must keep in mind that correlations should be taken with a grain of salt).</p>

            <h2>How To Identify And Correct</h2>
            <h4> Nutrient Deficiencies</h4>
            <img src="images\nutrition.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A shocking 99 percent of Americans are nutrient deficient, including over 90 percent who are deficient in omega-3 fats and 50 percent who are deficient in magnesium. Add to that chronic stress and a heavily processed diet with foods lacking nutrition, and it's a recipe for nutrient-deficiency disaster.</p>
