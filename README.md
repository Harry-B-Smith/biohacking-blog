# biohacking-blog
Built a biohacking blog using a wireframe provided. This project was a part of my Full Stack Java Developer training as a trainee working remotely out of NY at FDM Group.
This was a really fun project. I got to focus solely on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I got a better understanding of Grids after this project. Still working on better understanding
how to move divs around the page with margin and padding. Felt I got the major design aspects of the project down, though, probably because of my days
in art school down in Savannah, GA. That degree in Fine Arts comes in handy sometimes.
